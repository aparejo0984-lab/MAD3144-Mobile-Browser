                With rice terraces shrouded in mist, beautiful green valleys and some of the <em>highest mountains</em> in the Philippines, Sagada is a remote getaway in a scenic part of the country. Here is our guide to getting the most out of Sagada.
              <p class="about-text">
                Only accessible by a series of steep hairpin turns, Sagada is a remote village, high up in the <b style="color:green">Cordillera Mountains</b>. With mist-shrouded farming terraces rising above verdant valleys, it’s a scenic destination for outdoor activities and cultural excursions in the Philippines.   
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                To <strong>Isolated enough</strong>  to be untouched by <u>Spanish invaders</u>, indigenous Filipino tribes have thrived in the region. Collectively known as the Igorot, much of life in Sagada is still based around <b>influences and traditional customs</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                 See the mysterious hanging coffins of Sagada, watch loom weavers spin traditional tribal patterns, and witness the pace of mountain life as farmers tend to their <i>neatly organised vegetable crops</i>.
              </p>

                <img src="./../../assets/images/blog/blog3-2.jpeg" width="600" height="812" loading="lazy" alt="hero banner"
                  class="w-100">
              </figure> 
              <p class="about-text">
              </p> 
              <p class="about-text">
                Hike forested trails through verdant valleys, wade through <mark>Sagada’s underground cave</mark> network and soak up the beauty of the lush mountainous rice terraces.  
              </p> 
              <p class="about-text">
                To protect this, the Philippines is <mark>dedicated to a greener future</mark> . Almost half of its total energy use comes from renewable sources, with <strong>Asia’s highest concentration of geothermal power</strong>. 
              </p> 
              <p class="about-text">
                Built around an active <em>coconut farm</em>, this venue makes good use of its resources: almost everything from the scaffolding to thatched roofs of its dorm rooms is taken from coconut trees, thoughtfully blending the environment into most aspects of your stay.

              <h2 class="h2 section-title">THE INDIGENOUS TRIBES OF SAGADA</h2>
              <p class="about-text">
                The indigenous people of the <u>Cordillera Mountains</u>  are referred to as the <strong>Igorot</strong>, however there are <mark>11 different ethnolinguistic groups</mark> making up a population of around 1.5 million. 
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                After the Spanish arrived in the Philippines in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, they sent missionaries to convert the indigenous population to Christianity. However, due to the diverse array of ethnic tribes in the highlands and the remote location, Spanish colonialism was not able to fully take hold.
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                 Nonetheless, each of the colonial eras, the Spanish, <b style="color:green">American and Japanese </b> have shaped the culture in the area in many ways.
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                Since Christian missionaries began converting the indigenous population at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, most people in Sagada are now Christian. However, the distinctive native religions of the area still shape many of the customs practised today; the most notable of which is the hanging coffins of Sagada.
